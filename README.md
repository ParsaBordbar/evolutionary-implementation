# Evolutionary Implementation

This repository contains a collection of **Evolutionary Algorithm implementations** and example problems solved using these methods.  
Some of the implementations are based on assignments and materials from the _Evolutionary Computation_ course in the Master’s in Artificial Intelligence program.


## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository is a **self-contained project**, including:

- its own Python codebase  
- a dedicated README explaining the theory, approach, and results  
- plots / figures (if applicable)  
- a brief report or problem description  

You can explore each implementation directly through its folder.


## Tech Stack

Most implementations use:

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** — numerical computation
- **Matplotlib** — visualization and performance plots

If additional libraries are used, they will be explicitly listed inside each project’s README.


## 📚 List of Implementations

- [Genetic Algorithm for Scheduling](genetic_algorithm_for_scheduling)
- [n_queens_with_ga](n_queens_with_ga)
- [simple_ga](simple_ga)


## 🚀 Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ParsaBordbar/evolutionary-implementation.git
cd evolutionary-implementation
```

Run them using uv (or python3):

```
uv run main.py
```
