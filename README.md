# Evolutionary Implementation

This repository contains a collection of **Evolutionary Algorithm implementations** and example problems solved using these methods.  
Some of the implementations are based on assignments and materials from the _Evolutionary Computation_ course in the Master’s in Artificial Intelligence program.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository is a **self-contained project**, including:

- its own Python codebase  
- a dedicated README explaining the theory, approach, and results  
- plots / figures (if applicable)  
- a brief report or problem description  

You can explore each implementation directly through its folder.

---

## Tech Stack

Most implementations use:

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** — numerical computation
- **Matplotlib** — visualization and performance plots

If additional libraries are used, they will be explicitly listed inside each project’s README.
